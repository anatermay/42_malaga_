6:43 AM and I'm back at it 💻

This is what the "developer lifestyle" actually looks like:
- Messy desk ✅

Anyone else living on coffee and pure stubbornness? 😅

### Story Text
```
5 hours deep in the debugging rabbit hole 🕳️

Reality check: Programming is 20% writing code, 80% figuring out why it doesn't work

Today's debugging toolkit:
- printf() everywhere
- Stack Overflow (my savior)
- Pure determination
- Questionable amount of caffeine

Plot twist: The bug was a single missing character 🤦‍♂️
