🧵 **I just solved the DINING PHILOSOPHERS problem and it's INSANE!** ⚡

Watch 5 philosophers eat simultaneously without ANY deadlocks or race conditions! 🤯

**What you're seeing:**
📱 5 threads running concurrently
🍽️ Shared resources (forks) managed perfectly
⚡ Mutex synchronization preventing chaos
🧠 Zero deadlocks, zero data races
💎 Pure threading mastery in C!

**This is the famous Dining Philosophers Problem** - one of the most challenging concurrency puzzles in computer science! 🎯

**The challenge:**
• 5 philosophers sitting at a round table
• 5 forks (shared resources)
• Each philosopher needs 2 forks to eat
• They can only eat, think, or sleep
• NO deadlocks allowed!
• NO race conditions!

**My solution handles:**
✅ Thread creation and management
✅ Mutex synchronization
✅ Deadlock prevention algorithms
✅ Race condition elimination
✅ Resource sharing optimization
✅ Precise timing control

**Why this matters:**
🧠 Foundation of multithreaded programming
⚡ Critical for modern software development
🔧 Core concept in operating systems
🚀 Essential for high-performance applications

**The crazy part?** All 5 philosophers run simultaneously, share resources safely, and never get stuck! This is what separates real programmers from script kiddies 💪

**This is Rank 03 at @42malaga** - where we don't just learn threading theory, we implement it from scratch!

**The journey:** libft → ft_printf → get_next_line → push_swap → so_long → minitalk → **PHILOSOPHERS** → minishell

Currently conquering Rank 04! Next up: cub3d and advanced C++ 🎮
