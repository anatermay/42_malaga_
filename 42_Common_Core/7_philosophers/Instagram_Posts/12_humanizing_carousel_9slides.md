📖 The real story behind my 42 journey (that nobody talks about)

Everyone shows the highlight reel—the completed projects, the "I got it!" moments, the success celebrations.

But what about the 3 AM debugging sessions? The impostor syndrome? The days you question if you're smart enough?

🎯 Here's my ACTUAL journey through the philosophers project:

**Week 1**: "How hard can this be?"
**Week 3**: "I don't understand anything about threading"
**Week 5**: "Maybe I should switch careers"
**Week 7**: "OH! That's how it works!"
**Week 8**: "I can't believe I built this"

💡 The real lessons weren't in the code:

• Persistence beats talent when talent doesn't persist
• Your peers are your greatest teachers
• Failure is just feedback in disguise
• Every expert was once a beginner
• The struggle makes the victory meaningful

🔥 What changed everything for me:
- Embracing the discomfort of not knowing
- Asking questions without shame
- Celebrating small wins daily
- Finding my study tribe at 42 Málaga
- Realizing that confusion means growth

To everyone grinding through tough projects right now:

That frustration you're feeling? It's your brain building new neural pathways. That confusion? It's the space between what you know and what you're about to learn.

Keep going. Your breakthrough moment is closer than you think.

💬 What's the project that challenged you most? What did it teach you beyond the technical skills?

Let's normalize sharing the struggle—not just the success.
