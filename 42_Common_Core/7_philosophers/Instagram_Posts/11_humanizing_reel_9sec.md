## 📝 Caption Copy

🕒 3 AM debugging sessions hit different...

This was me week 7 at @42malaga, staring at the philosophers project like it personally offended me 😅

🧠 The mental journey of this project:
• Day 1: "How hard can dining philosophers be?"
• Day 20: "I understand nothing about threading"
• Day 47: "Maybe I'm not cut out for this"
• Day 52: "OH! That's how mutexes work!"
• Day 55: ✅ Project completed

💡 Real talk: The hardest part wasn't the algorithm—it was learning to debug my own assumptions about how computers work.

Every error message taught me something. Every segfault made me stronger. Every successful compilation felt like winning the lottery.

🔥 What nobody tells you about 42:
• You'll question everything you thought you knew
• Google becomes your best friend
• Peer learning saves your sanity
• Breakthrough moments happen at 3 AM
• The struggle makes the victory sweeter

To everyone grinding through tough projects right now: that frustration you're feeling? It's your brain rewiring itself to think like a programmer.

Trust the process. Embrace the struggle. Your future self will thank you.

💪 Currently tackling minishell (send help and coffee)
