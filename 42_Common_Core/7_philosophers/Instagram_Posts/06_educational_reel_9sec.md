🧠 Ever wondered why philosophers can't eat together? 

The dining philosophers problem isn't just theory—it's REAL concurrency challenges we face every day in programming! 

🔥 Here's what I learned building this at @42malaga:
• Mutexes = Digital forks 🍴
• Deadlock = When everyone's waiting ⏳
• Threading = Making chaos into harmony ✨

This project taught me more about system programming than any textbook ever could.

💡 Want to master concurrent programming? Check out my journey through 42's curriculum—where theory meets practice!
