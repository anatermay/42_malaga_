The real ft_printf story: 30 days of confusion, breakthrough, and growth ➡️

This isn't my highlight reel. This is the actual emotional journey from "I understand printf" to truly understanding how variadic functions work at the memory level.

💭 THE UNFILTERED TRUTH:
Week 1: Overconfident and naive
Week 2: Completely lost in documentation  
Week 3: Almost quit programming entirely
Week 4: Slow breakthrough moments
Week 5: Everything finally clicked

🤐 WHAT I DON'T USUALLY SHARE:
• The 2 AM panic sessions when nothing made sense
• Googling "am I too stupid for programming?" (yes, really)
• The day I seriously considered switching majors
• Crying over segmentation faults (multiple times)
• The imposter syndrome that hit HARD

⚡ THE BREAKTHROUGH MOMENTS:
Day 19: "Wait... va_list is just a pointer to memory!"
Day 23: "I can implement ANY format specifier now!"
Day 28: "My code actually looks professional!"

🧠 WHAT ACTUALLY CHANGED:
Not just my code - my entire relationship with difficult concepts. I learned that confusion isn't failure, it's the price of real understanding.

💙 TO MY COMMUNITY:
I share this because programming education often shows the "after" without the "during." We see working code, perfect explanations, smooth tutorials.

But real learning is messy. It's non-linear. It's full of moments where you question everything.

🤝 THE TRUTH ABOUT MASTERY:
Every expert you admire has felt exactly like you do in your worst debugging session. The difference isn't talent - it's persistence through the confusion.

📍 WHERE ARE YOU RIGHT NOW?
• Still figuring out variadic functions? Normal.
• Struggling with format parsing? We've all been there.  
• Ready to quit? I almost did too.
• Starting to understand? The momentum is building!

Your timeline is YOUR timeline. Your struggle is valid. Your breakthrough is coming.
