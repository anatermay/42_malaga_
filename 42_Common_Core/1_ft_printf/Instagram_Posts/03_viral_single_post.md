POV: You just built your own printf() function and realize you're not the same programmer anymore 🔥

The difference between USING a function and UNDERSTANDING how it works? MIND-BLOWING! 🧠⚡

Before ft_printf:
❌ "printf() just works, why question it?"
❌ Black box thinking
❌ Copy-paste programming
❌ Limited debugging skills

After building ft_printf from scratch:
✅ "I AM the printf now!"
✅ Deep systems understanding
✅ Variadic function mastery
✅ Format parsing expertise
✅ Memory management ninja

🔥 REAL TALK:
This project broke me and rebuilt me as a programmer. When you can recreate the tools you've been using, everything clicks differently!

The moment you successfully parse "%d %s %x %p" and output exactly what the original printf would? That's when you level up from code user to code creator! 🚀

💡 WHAT CHANGED:
• Debugging became surgical, not random
• Understanding function internals became intuitive
• Confidence in tackling "impossible" projects skyrocketed
• Interview questions about printf? Bring them on!

⚡ THE RIPPLE EFFECT:
ft_printf mastery made every subsequent 42 project easier:
- get_next_line: Buffer management skills transferred perfectly
- File descriptors: Already understood the underlying mechanics
- Memory handling: Printf taught me defensive programming

To everyone still afraid of "advanced" projects: Start building instead of just using. The understanding you gain is IRREPLACEABLE! 💪

PS: Yes, I've implemented printf() variants at least 23 different ways. Zero regrets! 😅
