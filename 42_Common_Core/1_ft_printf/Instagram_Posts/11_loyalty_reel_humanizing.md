## Caption Copy (Instagram Reel - Max 2,200 characters)

2:47 AM, still debugging ft_printf... and then it finally clicked 💙

This was my breakthrough moment with variadic functions. Not glamorous, not Instagram-perfect, just real learning happening in real time.

💭 THE HONEST MOMENT:
I'd been staring at va_arg() for hours, convinced I understood it, but my printf kept segfaulting on complex format strings. That feeling when you THINK you know something but reality says otherwise? Humbling.

🕰️ THE TIMELINE:
11 PM: "This should be easy, I understand the theory"
1 AM: "Why isn't this working?!"
2 AM: "Maybe I should sleep and try tomorrow..."
2:47 AM: "Wait... what if the problem is..."
2:48 AM: "OH! The type promotion in va_arg()!"

That moment when confusion transforms into clarity? Pure magic ✨

💡 WHAT ACTUALLY CHANGED:
Not just the code - my understanding. I went from "using" variadic functions to truly GETTING how they work at the memory level. That's the difference between copying tutorials and actually learning.

🤝 TO MY COMMUNITY:
I share these 3 AM moments because programming isn't just about the victories. It's about the persistence through confusion, the late nights when nothing makes sense, and the small breakthroughs that make it all worth it.

Every expert was once a beginner sitting exactly where you are right now, feeling lost and wondering if they'll ever understand.

💪 THE REMINDER:
Your pace is your pace. Your breakthrough is coming. Those hours of confusion aren't wasted - they're building the foundation for understanding that no tutorial can give you.

Keep going. The click is closer than you think 🚀
