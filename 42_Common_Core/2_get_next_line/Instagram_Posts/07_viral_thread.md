🧵 THREAD: The get_next_line() secrets that 90% of programmers don't know...

These insights from 42 School will change how you handle file I/O forever 🔥

#42School #GetNextLine #FileIO #CProgramming 

👇 Let's dive deep...

### Post 2/7
Most developers struggle with file I/O because they don't understand this ONE concept...

They try to read entire files into memory 😵‍💫

Result? Memory crashes with large files! 

There's a better way... 👇

### Post 3/7
The game-changer? Static variables 💡

Here's why they're CRUCIAL for get_next_line():

Static variables preserve data between function calls ✨

This means your buffer survives each call! 🚀

### Post 4/7
Static variables vs automatic variables:

Automatic: Created/destroyed each call ❌
Static: Persist between calls ✅

This is why get_next_line() can remember where it left off! 🧠

### Post 5/7
BUFFER_SIZE optimization secrets:

• Size 1: Too many system calls 🐌
• Size 4096: Sweet spot for most files ⚡
• Size too large: Wasted memory 💸

Pro tip: 42 works great for 42 School! 😉

### Post 6/7
Avoid these 3 deadly mistakes:

❌ Not freeing allocated memory
❌ Not handling EOF properly  
❌ Forgetting to null-terminate strings

These cause segfaults and memory leaks! 💥

### Post 7/7
Master these concepts and file I/O becomes trivial! 💪

Currently conquering 42 School:
✅ get_next_line MASTERED!
🚀 minishell COMPLETE!
