💕 The REAL story behind my get_next_line() journey... 

Swipe to see the messy, beautiful, absolutely chaotic path from confused beginner to (somewhat) confident coder! 👆

🤗 **Why I'm sharing the behind-the-scenes:**
Because social media often shows just the victories, but the real magic happens in the struggles. If you're fighting with file I/O right now, this is for you.

📚 **My honest timeline:**
• Week 1: Completely lost, questioning life choices
• Week 2: Still confused but stubbornly determined  
• Week 3: Small breakthrough with static variables
• Week 4: Actually reading files successfully!
• Now: Teaching others and still learning every day

💭 **What nobody tells you about learning to code:**
→ You'll feel stupid more often than smart (that's normal!)
→ Stack Overflow becomes your second home
→ The smallest victories feel HUGE
→ Imposter syndrome is real but temporary
→ The community is your lifeline

🌱 **To everyone in their coding journey:**
Your frustration is valid. Your progress matters. Your questions aren't stupid. Your journey is unique and valuable.

My 42 School progression:
✅ Rank 00: libft (the foundation that broke me and built me)
✅ Rank 01: get_next_line (this emotional rollercoaster!)  
🔄 Rank 01: ft_printf, born2beroot (current challenges)
🎯 Rank 02: push_swap, minitalk, so_long (future adventures)
🚀 Rank 03: minishell (COMPLETED! Still can't believe it!)

Each project teaches you more than just coding - patience, persistence, problem-solving, and humility.
