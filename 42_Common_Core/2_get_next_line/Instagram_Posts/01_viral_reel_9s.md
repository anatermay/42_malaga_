🔥 That moment when your get_next_line() reads PERFECTLY line by line! 

Reading files efficiently is a superpower every programmer needs 💪

✨ What get_next_line taught me:
• File descriptor mastery
• Buffer management genius
• Memory optimization 
• Handle ANY file size

No more loading entire files into memory - read smart, not hard! 🧠

Currently crushing 42 School:
✅ Rank 00: libft (MASTERED!)
✅ Rank 01: get_next_line (COMPLETE!)
🔄 Rank 01: ft_printf, born2beroot
🎯 Rank 02: push_swap, minitalk, so_long
🚀 Rank 03: minishell (FINISHED!)

From reading single lines to building entire shells - the progression is REAL! 🚀

💡 Pro tip: Master file I/O before tackling complex projects!
