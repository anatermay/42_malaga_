📚 HOW get_next_line() REALLY WORKS (Technical Breakdown)

Let me break down the core mechanics that make this function so powerful for file I/O operations 🔧

🎯 Core Concepts Explained:

1️⃣ **Static Variables**: Preserve buffer state between function calls
2️⃣ **Buffer Management**: Efficient memory usage with BUFFER_SIZE
3️⃣ **File Descriptors**: Handle multiple files simultaneously
4️⃣ **Memory Safety**: Proper allocation and cleanup

💡 **Why this matters for your programming career:**
• Foundation for ALL file operations
• Used in databases, text editors, compilers
• Critical for system-level programming
• Essential for 42 School and beyond

🔍 **Technical Details:**
✓ Reads data in chunks (not entire file)
✓ Preserves unprocessed data in static buffer
✓ Handles edge cases (EOF, empty files, large files)
✓ Zero memory leaks when implemented correctly

My 42 School Journey:
✅ Rank 00: libft (Foundation)
✅ Rank 01: get_next_line (File I/O Mastery)
🔄 Rank 01: ft_printf, born2beroot
🎯 Rank 02: push_swap, minitalk, so_long
🚀 Rank 03: minishell (Complete Shell!)

From basic string manipulation to building complete shells - understanding file I/O is the bridge between simple and advanced programming 🌉
