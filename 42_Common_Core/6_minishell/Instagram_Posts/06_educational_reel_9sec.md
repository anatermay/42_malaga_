📚 **Shell Programming 101: How your terminal actually works** 🔧

Quick tutorial: What happens when you type a command? Let me break it down! 💡

**The 3-step process:**

1️⃣ **PARSING** - Shell reads your command and breaks it into parts
• Identifies the command (`ls`)
• Separates arguments (`-la`)  
• Handles special characters (`|`, `>`, `<`)

2️⃣ **EXECUTION** - Shell creates processes to run commands
• Uses `fork()` to create child process
• Uses `exec()` to replace process with command
• Manages file descriptors for I/O

3️⃣ **OUTPUT** - Results displayed in terminal
• Pipes connect commands together
• Redirections send output to files
• Return codes indicate success/failure

**Why this matters for developers:**
🧠 Understanding system internals makes you a better programmer
⚡ Shell scripting becomes intuitive when you know the mechanics
🔧 Debugging system issues requires this knowledge
🚀 Foundation for systems programming and DevOps

**Real example breakdown:**
```bash
ps aux | grep "nginx" | wc -l
```
• `ps aux` lists all processes
• `|` pipes output to next command
• `grep "nginx"` filters for nginx processes
• `|` pipes filtered results  
• `wc -l` counts the lines

**This is what I built in minishell** - a complete shell from scratch that handles all of this! 💪

**Key takeaways:**
✅ Shells are sophisticated parsing engines
✅ Process management is at the heart of UNIX
✅ Pipes and redirections are IPC mechanisms
✅ Understanding this deepens your programming knowledge
