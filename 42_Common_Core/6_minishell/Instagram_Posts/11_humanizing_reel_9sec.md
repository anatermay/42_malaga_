💭 **The real story behind building minishell** ✨

This reel shows what they don't teach you in tutorials - the emotional journey of learning systems programming 💻

**What you're actually seeing:**
😰 Week 2: "How do you even parse pipes?!"
🤔 Week 3: Staring at fork() documentation for hours
😤 Week 4: "Why won't this pipeline work?!"
💡 Week 5: Everything suddenly clicks
🎉 Week 6: "Wait... I actually built a shell!"

**The behind-the-scenes reality:**
• 47 segmentation faults before my first successful parse
• 3am whiteboard sessions trying to understand process trees
• Googling "what is dup2" more times than I care to admit
• That moment when your shell finally runs `ls | grep txt`
• Realizing you understand UNIX at a completely different level

**Why I'm sharing this vulnerable moment:**

Because Instagram shows the highlights - the working code, the successful demos, the "look how easy this was!" posts. But learning systems programming isn't easy. It's messy, confusing, and sometimes overwhelming.

**To everyone learning to code:** Your struggle is completely normal. That feeling of being lost in system calls? We've all been there. Those debugging sessions that feel endless? They're making you a better developer.

**What I learned beyond the code:**
✨ Persistence beats perfection every time
✨ Understanding fundamentals changes everything
✨ The community makes the impossible possible
✨ Every expert was once a confused beginner
✨ Building tools is infinitely more satisfying than just using them

**This is Rank 03 at @42malaga** - where we don't just learn to code, we learn to think like the people who built the tools we use every day.

**From string manipulation in libft to building a complete shell** - each project builds on the last, creating a foundation of real understanding.

**Currently working on:** cub3d (3D raycasting engine) and yes, it's just as challenging and rewarding! 🎮
