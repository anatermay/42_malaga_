**MINISHELL: The ultimate systems programming challenge** 💻

This isn't just another coding project - it's a deep dive into the heart of UNIX systems. Building a shell means understanding how your computer actually works at the lowest level.

**What you'll discover in these slides:**
🔧 Complete system architecture breakdown
⚡ Advanced C programming techniques
🧠 Process management mastery
🔥 Pipeline and redirection magic
💎 Built-in command implementation
🚀 Signal handling expertise

**The numbers behind the code:**
• 2000+ lines of pure C
• 15+ built-in commands implemented
• Full pipeline support with unlimited pipes
• Environment variable management
• Signal handling for graceful execution
• Complete memory management (no leaks!)

**Why minishell matters:**
This project teaches you everything bash does under the hood. Every command you type, every pipe you use, every redirection - you learn to build it all from scratch.

**Technical highlights:**
✅ Lexical analysis and parsing
✅ Abstract Syntax Tree construction
✅ Process creation and management
✅ Inter-process communication
✅ File descriptor manipulation
✅ Signal handling and job control

**From theory to practice:**
Started with basic string manipulation in libft, progressed through formatted output with ft_printf, mastered file reading with get_next_line, conquered algorithms with push_swap, created games with so_long, built communication with minitalk, solved concurrency with philosophers, and NOW - built a complete shell!

**This is Rank 03 at @42malaga** - where we stop using the tools and start building them! 💪
