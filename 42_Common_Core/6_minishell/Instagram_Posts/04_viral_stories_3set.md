**Requirements:**
✅ Command parsing
✅ Process execution  
✅ Pipeline support
✅ Built-in commands
✅ Environment variables
✅ Signal management
✅ Memory management

**Difficulty:** EXTREME 📈
**Time given:** 3 weeks ⏰
**Lines of code needed:** 2000+ 💻

*This is Rank 03 at @42malaga*

**Poll:** Could you build a shell from scratch?
🔹 Absolutely!
🔹 Maybe with help...
🔹 No way! 😅

### Story 2 Text Content:
**"THE MAGIC MOMENT ✨"**

*Watch my custom shell in action!*

```bash
cat file.txt | grep "pattern" | sort | uniq > output.txt
```

**THIS IS MY CODE RUNNING!** 🚀

Not bash. Not zsh. MY MINISHELL!

**What you're seeing:**
🔥 Custom command parser
⚡ Process management
🔗 Pipeline implementation
📝 Redirection handling
✨ Perfect execution

*From 0 to functional shell in 3 weeks!*

**Question:** What's the most complex terminal command you know? Show me in the comments! 👇

**Poll:** What's cooler?

### Story 3 Text Content:
**"SAME POWER AS BASH! ⚡"**

*Side-by-side comparison*

**LEFT:** Standard bash
**RIGHT:** My minishell

**Same commands. Same results. Same power.**

This is what 3 weeks of systems programming gets you - a shell that rivals the standard! 💪

**My shell handles:**
✅ Complex pipelines
✅ Environment variables
✅ Built-in commands
✅ Signal processing
✅ Error handling
✅ Memory management

**From user to creator in one project** 🚀
