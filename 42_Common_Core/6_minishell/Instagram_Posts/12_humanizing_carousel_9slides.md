💝 **The real story behind minishell: A journey of growth, struggle, and community** ✨

*Swipe to see the honest, unfiltered experience →*

This isn't a highlight reel - it's the complete story, including all the messy, beautiful, frustrating parts that made me who I am as a developer today.

**Why I'm sharing this vulnerable journey:**

Because social media shows us the finished products, the polished GitHub repos, the successful deployments. But the real growth happens in the struggle, in the 2am debugging sessions, in the moments when you want to give up but don't.

**What you'll see in these slides:**
📸 My actual workspace during those long coding nights
😰 Screenshots of the errors that made me question everything
📚 The learning resources that became my lifeline
🤝 The community that carried me through the hardest parts
💡 The exact moment everything clicked
🚀 How this project changed me beyond just coding skills

**The honest truth about learning systems programming:**

It's not about being naturally gifted. It's about showing up every day, even when you don't understand anything. It's about asking questions, making mistakes, and getting back up every time you fall.

**My minishell timeline:**
• **Week 1:** "What even is a token?" (pure confusion)
• **Week 2:** "How do processes work?" (existential crisis)
• **Week 3:** "Why won't this parse correctly?" (debugging hell)
• **Week 4:** "Maybe I'm not cut out for this" (imposter syndrome peak)
• **Week 5:** "Wait, I think I get it now!" (first breakthrough)
• **Week 6:** "My shell actually works!" (pure joy)

**What this project really taught me:**

🧠 **Technical skills** - Yes, I learned system calls, process management, and parsing
💪 **Resilience** - How to persist through confusion and frustration
🤝 **Community** - The incredible power of learning together
❤️ **Self-compassion** - That struggle doesn't mean failure
🚀 **Confidence** - If I can build a shell, I can learn anything

**To my fellow 42 students:** You're not alone in this journey. That project that's making you question everything? It's doing exactly what it's supposed to do - pushing you to grow.

**To aspiring developers:** Your timeline is not wrong. Your confusion is not a sign you don't belong. Your questions are not stupid. Every expert was once exactly where you are.

**To my future self:** Remember this journey. Remember how far you've come. Remember to be patient with others who are where you once were.

*The best part of this whole experience? Realizing that the goal isn't to stop struggling - it's to get comfortable with the discomfort of learning.*

**Current status:** Rank 04 at @42malaga, working on cub3d, and still debugging at 2am (some things never change! 😅)
