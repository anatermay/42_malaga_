🚀 **From basic terminal to CUSTOM SHELL in 2 weeks!** ⚡

Watch me transform from simple bash commands to building my own fully functional shell! 🔥

**What you just saw:**
📱 Standard terminal → Custom minishell
🔧 2000+ lines of C code
⚡ Full UNIX shell recreation
💎 Pipes, redirections, built-ins - EVERYTHING!

**This is minishell - Rank 03 at @42malaga** 🎯

Built from scratch:
✅ Command parsing & execution
✅ Environment variable handling  
✅ Signal management
✅ Built-in commands (cd, echo, pwd, env, export, unset, exit)
✅ Pipeline and redirection support
✅ History functionality

**Why this matters:**
🧠 Deep understanding of UNIX systems
⚡ Process management mastery
🔧 Advanced C programming
🚀 Shell programming fundamentals

**The journey:** libft → ft_printf → get_next_line → push_swap → so_long → minitalk → philosophers → **MINISHELL**
