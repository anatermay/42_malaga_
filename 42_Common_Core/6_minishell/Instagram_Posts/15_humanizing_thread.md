**🧵 THREAD: My brutally honest minishell journey - from "what's a pipe?" to building a working shell**

*If you're struggling with a coding project right now, this one's for you. It gets better, I promise.*

---

**1/16 💔 THE BREAKDOWN**

Three weeks into minishell, I sat on my bedroom floor at 3am and cried.

Not because I'm weak. Not because I don't belong here. But because I was so overwhelmed by system calls and process management that I couldn't see a way forward.

*I almost quit 42 School that night.*

---

**2/16 😰 THE IMPOSTER SYNDROME**

Everyone else seemed to understand parsing immediately while I was still googling "what is a token in programming" and pretending to nod along in peer discussions.

I felt like a fraud. Like I'd somehow tricked my way into 42 and it was only a matter of time before everyone realized I didn't belong.

*Sound familiar?*

---

**3/16 🤝 THE FIRST LIFELINE**

A classmate found me debugging in the lab at 2am, clearly frustrated. Instead of judging, they sat down and said:

"Hey, I spent 6 hours yesterday trying to understand fork(). Want to figure it out together?"

*That moment changed everything.*

---

**4/16 📚 THE LEARNING CURVE**

Week 1: "What's the difference between a shell and a terminal?"
Week 2: "How do you parse a string with pipes?"
Week 3: "Why won't my processes communicate?"
Week 4: "Maybe I should just drop out..."
Week 5: "Wait, I think I'm starting to get it..."

*Progress isn't linear, and that's okay.*

---

**5/16 💡 THE BREAKTHROUGH**

Week 6: My first successful pipeline.

`ls | grep .c | wc -l`

When that simple command worked in MY shell - the shell I built from scratch - I literally jumped out of my chair and did a happy dance in the lab.

*My classmates thought I was losing it. I was gaining it.*

---

**6/16 🌱 WHAT CHANGED**

Not my intelligence. Not my natural ability. But my relationship with confusion.

I stopped seeing "I don't understand" as evidence I didn't belong, and started seeing it as "I don't understand YET."

That one word - YET - is magic.

---

**7/16 🧠 THE MINDSET SHIFT**

From: "Everyone else gets this and I don't"
To: "We're all figuring this out together"

From: "I should know this by now"
To: "Learning takes time, and that's normal"

From: "I'm behind"
To: "I'm on my own timeline"

*Comparison is the thief of learning.*

---

**8/16 ❤️ THE COMMUNITY**

The 42 community saved me. People who:
• Answered my "stupid" questions without judgment
• Celebrated my small wins like they were huge victories
• Reminded me that struggle is part of the process
• Made me feel less alone in the confusion

*Coding is a team sport, even when you're coding alone.*

---

**9/16 🔧 THE ACTUAL LEARNING**

Yes, I learned technical skills:
• Process management with fork/exec
• Pipeline implementation with pipes
• Signal handling for user interaction
• Memory management without leaks

But more importantly, I learned how to learn hard things.

---

**10/16 💪 THE RESILIENCE**

Minishell taught me:
• How to sit with confusion without panicking
• How to break impossible problems into smaller pieces
• How to ask for help without feeling ashamed
• How to persist when everything feels overwhelming

*These skills matter more than any technical knowledge.*

---

**11/16 🎯 THE REALIZATION**

The goal was never to build a perfect shell on the first try. The goal was to become the kind of person who can figure out how to build a shell.

Every bug, every frustration, every moment of confusion was building that person.

*The struggle was the point.*

---

**12/16 📈 THE GROWTH**

Looking back, I can see the progression:
• Week 1: Completely lost
• Week 3: Starting to understand pieces
• Week 5: Connecting the dots
• Week 7: Building something real
• Week 8: Feeling like a different person

*Growth happens so gradually you don't notice it, until suddenly you do.*

---

**13/16 🚀 THE CURRENT STATE**

Now I'm working on cub3d (3D raycasting) and yes, I'm confused again. But this time, confusion feels different. It feels like the beginning of understanding, not evidence of inability.

*I know how to learn hard things now.*

---

**14/16 💝 TO EVERYONE STRUGGLING**

Your confusion is not evidence you don't belong.
Your slow progress is still progress.
Your questions are not stupid.
Your timeline is not wrong.
Your struggle is temporary.

*You are becoming the person who can solve these problems.*

---

**15/16 🤗 THE INVITATION**

If you're working on a challenging project and need:
• Someone to vent about segfaults to
• Help breaking down a complex problem
• Just encouragement that you're not alone

My DMs are open. Seriously.

*We rise by lifting others.*

---

**16/16 ✨ THE PROMISE**

It gets better. Not easier - better. You get stronger, more resilient, more confident in your ability to figure things out.

That project that's making you want to quit? It's making you into the developer you're meant to be.

*Trust the process. Trust yourself.*
