🤯 **I just recreated BASH from scratch and the result is INSANE** ⚡

Look at this transformation! From using basic terminal commands to building my own fully functional UNIX shell! 🚀

**What you're seeing:**
📱 LEFT: Standard bash (what everyone uses)
🔥 RIGHT: My custom minishell (what I built!)

**This isn't just a copy - it's a complete reimplementation:**

✅ **Custom Command Parser** - Tokenizes and interprets every command
✅ **Process Management** - Creates and controls child processes  
✅ **Pipeline Support** - Unlimited command chaining with pipes
✅ **Redirection Magic** - Input/output redirection handling
✅ **Built-in Commands** - cd, echo, pwd, env, export, unset, exit
✅ **Environment Variables** - Full $VAR expansion and management
✅ **Signal Handling** - Proper Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D, Ctrl+\ behavior
✅ **History Support** - Command history with up/down arrows

**The crazy part?** My shell can run commands that even some modern shells struggle with! 💪

**Example of what my minishell handles:**
```bash
cat file.txt | grep "pattern" | sort | uniq > output.txt 2>&1
```

**This is the power of Rank 03 at @42malaga!** 🎯

We don't just use tools - we build them from the ground up. Understanding every system call, every process fork, every file descriptor manipulation.

**The journey to get here:**
🏗️ libft (string manipulation mastery)
📝 ft_printf (formatted output control)  
📖 get_next_line (file reading expertise)
🔄 push_swap (algorithm optimization)
🎮 so_long (graphics and game loops)
📡 minitalk (inter-process communication)
🧠 philosophers (concurrency and threading)
💻 **MINISHELL** (complete systems programming)

**Next challenge:** cub3d (3D raycasting engine) 🎮

**The result?** I understand my computer at a level most developers never reach. Every command, every process, every system call - I've built it all.

*This is why 42 School works. We don't memorize syntax - we understand systems.* 🔥
