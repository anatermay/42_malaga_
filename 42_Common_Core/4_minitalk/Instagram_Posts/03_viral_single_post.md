🤯 Just witnessed pure programming magic: Processes talking without shared memory!

This is MINITALK - the 42 project that completely blew my mind! ⚡

**The Impossible Made Possible:**
How do you send a message from one program to another using ONLY two signals? 

Welcome to the world of UNIX signal mastery! 🎯

**The Technical Wizardry:**
🔹 Client converts each character to 8 bits
🔹 Sends bits one by one using SIGUSR1 (0) and SIGUSR2 (1)
🔹 Server receives signals and reconstructs the message
🔹 All happening in REAL-TIME!

**Mind = Blown Moments:**
• Realizing you can communicate with just two signals
• Watching binary bits flow between processes
• That moment when "Hello World!" appears perfectly
• Understanding how the OS kernel facilitates this magic

**Why This is Revolutionary:**
This isn't just a coding exercise - it's fundamental systems programming! Every notification on your phone, every system alert, every background process communication - they all use signal-based mechanisms! 📱💻

**The Real Challenge:**
❌ No shared memory allowed
❌ No pipes or files
❌ Just pure signal handling
✅ Reliable message transmission

**Technical Deep Dive:**
The beauty lies in the simplicity - sigaction() for signal handling, bit manipulation for encoding, and PID management for targeting specific processes. It's elegant AF! 💫

**Real-World Impact:**
Understanding process communication is CRUCIAL for:
🌐 System administration
🔧 DevOps engineering
💻 Embedded systems
🚀 High-performance computing

Currently dominating Rank 02 at 42 Málaga and this project just opened my eyes to the incredible world of inter-process communication!

**The satisfaction when your first message transmits perfectly?** UNMATCHED! 🔥
