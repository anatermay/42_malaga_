🔥 This project literally made me question everything I knew about programming! 

Swipe to discover how I made processes communicate without ANY shared memory ➡️

MINITALK isn't just another 42 project - it's a masterclass in:
✨ UNIX signal mastery
🎯 Binary encoding genius  
💡 Process communication wizardry
🔥 Real-time data transmission

**The Mind-Blowing Concept:**
Imagine two separate programs talking to each other using only two simple signals! No pipes, no shared memory, no files - just pure UNIX magic! 🪄

**What I Learned:**
• Signal handling with sigaction()
• Binary encoding/decoding algorithms
• Process ID management
• Error handling in inter-process communication

**The Technical Beauty:**
Every single character gets converted to 8 bits and transmitted one by one using SIGUSR1 (for 0) and SIGUSR2 (for 1). The server reconstructs the message bit by bit! 🤯

**Real-World Applications:**
This isn't just academic - signal-based communication powers:
🌐 System notifications
📱 Mobile app background processes
🖥️ Operating system internals
⚡ Real-time system coordination

**The Satisfaction Factor:**
Watching your client send "Hello, 42!" and seeing it appear on your server terminal? PURE EUPHORIA! 🚀

**Why This Matters:**
Understanding how processes communicate is fundamental to becoming a systems programmer. This project teaches you to think like an operating system! 🧠

Currently crushing Rank 02 at 42 Málaga and this challenge just elevated my understanding of systems programming to a whole new level!

Who else loves diving deep into the OS internals? Drop a 🔥 if process communication excites you!
