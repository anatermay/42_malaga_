🚀 POV: You're making processes talk to each other like magic! ✨

This is MINITALK - one of the most mind-blowing projects at 42 School! 🤯

Imagine sending messages between programs using only UNIX signals... SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 are about to become your best friends! 💫

✨ What makes this incredible:
• Process communication through signals
• Binary encoding mastery
• Real-time message transmission
• Zero shared memory needed

The satisfaction when your client sends "Hello World!" and your server receives it perfectly? UNMATCHED! 🔥

🎯 The magic behind it:
• Convert each character to binary
• Send bit by bit using signals
• Reconstruct the message on the server
• All happening in real-time!

Currently dominating Rank 02 at 42 Málaga and this project just blew my mind! 🧠💥

Who else gets excited about inter-process communication? Drop a 📡 if signals make you geek out!

This is why I love systems programming - it's like conducting an orchestra of processes! 🎼
