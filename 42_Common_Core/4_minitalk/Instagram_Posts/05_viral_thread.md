🤯 Just discovered the most mind-blowing way to make processes communicate!

MINITALK at 42 School taught me something incredible: You can send entire messages using only TWO signals! 

Here's the magic:
✨ Convert each character to 8 bits
📡 Send bit by bit using SIGUSR1 (0) and SIGUSR2 (1)  
🔄 Server reconstructs the message in real-time
💫 Zero shared memory needed!

The moment when your client sends "Hello World!" and it appears perfectly on your server? PURE EUPHORIA! 🚀

This isn't just a coding exercise - it's fundamental to understanding how:
🖥️ Operating systems handle notifications
📱 Apps communicate in the background  
⚡ Real-time systems coordinate processes
🌐 Distributed systems share information

**Technical Beauty:**
Every message becomes a stream of binary signals flowing between processes. It's like watching digital telepathy in action! 

The elegance of using just sigaction(), bit manipulation, and PID management to create reliable communication? Chef's kiss! 👨‍🍳💋

Currently crushing Rank 02 at 42 Málaga and this project just opened my eyes to the incredible world of inter-process communication!

## 🎯 Engagement Strategy for Threads:

### Cialdini's 6 Principles Applied:
1. **Reciprocity**: Sharing valuable technical insights for free
2. **Commitment**: Public commitment to continue sharing journey
3. **Social Proof**: Mentioning 42 School community and achievements  
4. **Authority**: Demonstrating deep technical understanding
5. **Liking**: Relatable amazement and discovery story
6. **Scarcity**: Unique 42 School experience and advanced knowledge

### AIDA Method Implementation:
- **Attention**: Hook with "most mind-blowing way" and shock emoji
- **Interest**: Technical details that intrigue systems programmers
- **Desire**: Showcasing the excitement and real-world applications
- **Action**: Clear call-to-action to follow and engage

### Hashtag Strategy:
- Mix of trending and niche technical hashtags
- Educational and inspirational tags for discoverability
- Location-based tag (#42Malaga) for community
- Systems programming specific tags for target audience

### Engagement Tactics:
- Ask direct questions to encourage comments
- Share specific technical details to establish credibility
- Use emojis strategically for visual appeal and emotion
- Include clear social media handles for discovery
- Create curiosity about the technical implementation

### Technical Storytelling:
- Break down complex concepts into digestible pieces
- Use metaphors ("digital telepathy") for accessibility
