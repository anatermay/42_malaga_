🎯 FROM CHAOS TO PERFECTION: My Push_Swap Success Story!

Remember when I said algorithms could be beautiful? THIS is what I meant! ✨

Just completed one of 42 School's most challenging projects and I'm still buzzing from the achievement! 🚀

What is Push_Swap?
🔹 Sort random numbers using only 2 stacks
🔹 Master 11 specific operations (push, swap, rotate)
🔹 Optimize for minimum moves
🔹 Handle edge cases like a pro

The Real Challenge:
❌ No bubble sort allowed
❌ No quick sort shortcuts  
❌ Pure logical thinking required
✅ Algorithm design from scratch

My Results:
🎯 100/100 Score achieved!
⚡ 573 operations for 100 numbers
🧠 Weeks of debugging and optimization
💡 Countless "aha!" moments

The most satisfying part? Watching that final test pass when your algorithm sorts 500 random numbers flawlessly! 

This project taught me more about:
• Data structure manipulation
• Algorithm complexity analysis
• Problem-solving under constraints
• Code optimization techniques

Currently conquering Rank 02 at 42 Málaga and absolutely loving every challenge!

Who else gets excited about elegant algorithms? Drop a 🔥 if you love the satisfaction of clean, efficient code!
