🔥 POV: You're solving one of the most satisfying coding challenges at 42 School! 

Did you know that sorting algorithms can be THIS mesmerizing? 🤯

Push_swap isn't just another project - it's a masterclass in efficiency, optimization, and algorithmic thinking! 

✨ What makes this special:
• Converting chaos into perfect order
• Learning stack manipulation
• Optimizing for minimum operations
• Building logical thinking

The satisfaction when your algorithm sorts 500 numbers in under 5500 operations? *Chef's kiss* 👨‍🍳💋

🚀 Currently crushing Rank 02 at 42 Málaga and loving every challenging moment!
