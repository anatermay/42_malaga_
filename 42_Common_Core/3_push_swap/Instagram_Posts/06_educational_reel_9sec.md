📚 ALGORITHM TUTORIAL: How Push_Swap Actually Works!

Let me break down this fascinating 42 School challenge in the simplest way possible! 🧠✨

**The Challenge:**
Sort random numbers using only 2 stacks and 11 specific operations. No traditional sorting allowed!

**The Operations (Master These):**
• sa/sb/ss - Swap first 2 elements
• pa/pb - Push from one stack to another  
• ra/rb/rr - Rotate stack upward
• rra/rrb/rrr - Rotate stack downward

**The Strategy:**
1️⃣ Analyze the problem size
2️⃣ Use divide & conquer approach
3️⃣ Optimize for minimum operations
4️⃣ Handle edge cases gracefully

**Why This Matters:**
🎯 Teaches efficient algorithm design
🧩 Develops problem-solving skills
💡 Understanding stack data structures
⚡ Optimization thinking

**Real-World Applications:**
• Database query optimization
• Memory management systems
• Compiler optimization
• Game AI pathfinding

This project isn't just academic - it's building fundamental computer science thinking that applies everywhere in tech! 

The satisfaction when your algorithm sorts 500 numbers efficiently? Incredible! 🚀

**Pro Tips:**
💡 Start with small test cases
🔍 Visualize your algorithm first
📊 Track operation counts
🧪 Test edge cases thoroughly
