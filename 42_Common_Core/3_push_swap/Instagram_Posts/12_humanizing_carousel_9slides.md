💭 The real, unfiltered story of my push_swap journey...

Swipe to see what actually happened behind the "success" posts ➡️

**The Truth About Learning to Code:**
It's messy. It's emotional. It's deeply human.

**Week 1:** Stared at the project description for 3 hours straight. Felt completely lost. Questioned every life choice that led me to 42 School. 😅

**Week 2:** Had my first breakthrough! Understood what a stack actually was. Felt like a genius for exactly 17 minutes before hitting the next wall. 🤦‍♀️

**Week 3:** Met my study group. Realized EVERYONE was struggling. Suddenly felt less alone in this wild journey. Community is everything! 🤝

**The Real Lessons:**
✨ Confusion is not a character flaw - it's a sign you're learning
💪 Every expert was once a complete beginner  
🧠 Your brain needs time to process complex concepts
🤗 Vulnerability builds stronger connections than perfection

**What push_swap actually taught me:**
• How to be patient with my own learning process
• That asking for help is a strength, not a weakness
• How to break impossibly complex problems into tiny pieces
• That persistence beats talent every single time

**To anyone currently struggling with ANY learning challenge:**

Your confusion is valid. Your frustration is normal. Your breakthrough is coming. 🌱

I spent more time debugging my mindset than my code, and that was exactly what I needed to do! 

**The most important algorithm I learned?**
How to be kind to myself while learning something difficult. 💝

**For my fellow 42 students:**
Let's normalize talking about the real experience - the late nights, the impostor syndrome, the small victories, the emotional rollercoaster. 

We're not just building software - we're building resilience, community, and character! 

**Your turn:**
What's one honest thing about your learning journey that you don't usually share? Let's create a space for real talk! 👇
