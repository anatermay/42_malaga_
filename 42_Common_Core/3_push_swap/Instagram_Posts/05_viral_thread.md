🧠 Just conquered one of 42 School's most notorious challenges: Push_Swap!

The mission? Sort random numbers using only 2 stacks and 11 specific operations. Sounds simple? Think again! 🤯

My results:
✅ 100/100 score
⚡ 573 operations for 100 numbers  
🔥 3 weeks of pure optimization

The algorithm design process taught me more about efficiency and problem-solving than any textbook ever could.

This is why I love 42 School - they don't just teach you to code, they teach you to THINK like a computer scientist! 🚀

Currently crushing Rank 02 at 42 Málaga. Who else is on this incredible journey?
