🧠 This algorithm challenge literally rewired my brain! 

Swipe to see how I conquered one of 42 School's most notorious projects ➡️

Push_swap isn't just about sorting numbers - it's about:
✨ Strategic thinking under constraints
🔥 Optimizing every single move  
💡 Understanding data structures deeply
🎯 Building efficient algorithms

The moment when your algorithm sorts 500 random numbers in under 5500 operations? Pure euphoria! 🚀

What I learned from this beast:
• Stack manipulation mastery
• Algorithm optimization techniques  
• Complex problem decomposition
• Performance analysis skills

Every failed attempt taught me something new. Every optimization felt like a small victory. 

This is why I love 42 School - they don't just teach you to code, they teach you to THINK like a programmer! 🧑‍💻

Currently in Rank 02 and absolutely loving the challenge! Who else is on this incredible journey?

Drop a 🔥 if you love algorithmic challenges!
