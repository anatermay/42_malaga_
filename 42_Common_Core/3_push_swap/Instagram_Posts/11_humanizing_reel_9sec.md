💭 The real story behind every "successful" algorithm implementation...

This is what they don't show you in coding tutorials! 😅

**The Reality:**
🌙 3 AM debugging sessions
☕ Way too much coffee
🤯 Moments of complete confusion
💡 Sudden breakthroughs at random times
😴 Falling asleep thinking about stack operations

**Push_swap taught me more than just algorithms:**

✨ **Patience with myself**: Progress isn't always linear
🧠 **Problem-solving resilience**: Every bug is a learning opportunity  
💪 **Persistence pays off**: The breakthrough always comes
🤝 **Community matters**: We're all struggling and growing together

**The human moments that matter:**
• The relief when code finally compiles
• The excitement of a small optimization win
• The frustration of segfaults at midnight
• The joy of understanding something new

**To everyone currently debugging at 2 AM:**
You're not alone! Every developer has been exactly where you are right now. 

That confusion you're feeling? It's not a sign you're not good enough - it's a sign you're learning something new and challenging! 🌱

**The truth about 42 School:**
It's not just about becoming a better programmer. It's about becoming a more resilient, thoughtful, and persistent human being.

Every project teaches you something about yourself, not just about code! 

**My breakthrough with push_swap came when I stopped trying to be perfect and started being curious.** 

Sometimes the best debugging happens when you step away from the screen and think like a human, not a machine! 🧗‍♀️
