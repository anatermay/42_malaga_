🤯 Just witnessed the most satisfying transformation: Pure C code becoming a playable 2D game!

This is SO_LONG - the 42 project that turned me into a game developer! 🎮✨

**The Impossible Made Real:**
How do you go from empty C functions to a fully interactive gaming experience? 

Welcome to the world of graphics programming with MLX42! 🚀

**The Technical Wizardry:**
🔹 Parse custom .ber map files into playable levels
🔹 Render sprites and textures in real-time
🔹 Handle collision detection with pixel precision
🔹 Manage game states and player interactions
🔹 All happening at smooth 60 FPS!

**Mind = Blown Moments:**
• Realizing pixels are just mathematical coordinates
• Watching your first sprite appear on screen
• That moment when collision detection actually works
• Seeing a complete game emerge from your algorithms

**Why This is Revolutionary:**
This isn't just a coding exercise - it's understanding the foundation of every game you've ever played! From mobile apps to console games, they all use these core concepts! 🎯

**The Real Challenge:**
❌ No game engines allowed
❌ No pre-built components  
❌ Pure C programming required
✅ Build everything from scratch

**Technical Deep Dive:**
The beauty lies in the simplicity - MLX42 provides the canvas, but YOU create the art. Map parsing, sprite management, input handling, and game logic all working in perfect harmony! 💫

**Real-World Impact:**
Understanding 2D graphics programming opens doors to:
🎮 Game development industry
🖥️ UI/UX programming
📱 Mobile app development
🎬 Animation and multimedia

Currently crushing Rank 02 at 42 Málaga and this project just showed me that programming is the ultimate creative medium!

**The moment when your character moves exactly where you intended?** PURE MAGIC! ⚡

Who else gets excited about bringing code to life visually? Drop a 🎮 if graphics programming fascinates you!

This is why I love game development - you're literally building interactive worlds with math and logic! 🌟
