🎮 POV: You just built your first 2D game from scratch at 42 School! 

This is SO_LONG - where algorithms meet gameplay magic! ✨

Ever wondered how classic 2D games actually work? This project just blew my mind! 🤯

✨ What makes this incredible:
• 2D graphics programming with MLX42
• Map validation and pathfinding algorithms
• Real-time collision detection
• Character movement and animation
• Game state management

The satisfaction when your character finally moves across the screen? UNMATCHED! 🔥

🎯 The technical wizardry:
• Parse .ber map files
• Render sprites and textures
• Handle keyboard input
• Implement game logic
• Optimize frame rendering

Currently conquering Rank 02 at 42 Málaga and this project taught me that game development is basically applied computer science! 🧠💫

Who else gets excited about bringing pixels to life? Drop a 🎮 if you love the magic of game development!

This is why I love programming - you're literally creating interactive worlds from pure logic! 🌟

From parsing maps to rendering graphics, every line of code brings your game closer to life!
