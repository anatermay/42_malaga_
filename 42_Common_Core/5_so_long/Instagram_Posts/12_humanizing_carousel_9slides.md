🎮 **My so_long journey: From complete beginner to game developer** ✨

*Swipe to see the real, unfiltered story behind the code →*

**This isn't a highlight reel - it's the real deal** 💭

I'm sharing this because I wish someone had told me what the journey actually looks like when I started. Not the polished GitHub commits, but the messy, beautiful, frustrating reality of learning to code.

**What you'll see in these slides:**
📸 My actual workspace during those 3am sessions
🐛 The 247 errors I got before my first successful run
😭 The moments I wanted to quit
💡 The breakthrough that changed everything
🚀 Where I am now and where I'm heading

**The honest truth about learning C at 42:**
• It's harder than you think it'll be
• It's more rewarding than you can imagine
• Community makes ALL the difference
• Every bug is a teacher in disguise
• Progress isn't linear (and that's okay!)

**To my fellow 42 students:** You're not alone in this struggle. That segfault that's driving you crazy? We've all been there. That moment when nothing makes sense? It's part of the process.

**To aspiring developers:** Your journey will look different from mine, but the feelings? Those are universal. Embrace the struggle - it's making you stronger.

**What I learned building so_long:**
✅ Memory management (the hard way)
✅ Graphics programming fundamentals  
✅ Debugging persistence
✅ The joy of creating something interactive
✅ That C is beautiful when you understand it

**Current status:** Rank 04 at @42malaga
**Next challenge:** cub3d (3D raycasting!)
**Goal:** Help others navigate their coding journey
