🎮 Just built my first complete 2D game using pure C programming!

SO_LONG at 42 School taught me something incredible: You can create entire interactive worlds with just code and MLX42! 

Here's the magic:
✨ Parse custom .ber map files into playable levels
🎯 Render sprites and handle real-time animations  
🔄 Implement collision detection and game physics
💫 Manage player input and game state transitions

The moment when your character moves smoothly across YOUR custom-designed map? PURE EUPHORIA! 🚀

This isn't just a coding exercise - it's understanding the foundation of every game ever made:
🖥️ How graphics are rendered frame by frame
📱 How user input translates to on-screen action
⚡ How game engines optimize performance
🌐 How interactive experiences come to life

**Technical Beauty:**
Every collectible, every wall collision, every victory screen - it's all mathematical precision disguised as fun! The elegance of transforming algorithms into adventures? Chef's kiss! 👨‍🍳💋

Currently conquering Rank 02 at 42 Málaga and this project opened my eyes to the incredible intersection of logic and creativity!

**Real-World Impact:**
These concepts power everything from:
🎮 Mobile games and indie titles
🖥️ Desktop application interfaces
📱 Interactive web experiences
🎬 Animation and multimedia software

The satisfaction when your first playable level loads perfectly? It changes how you see every game forever! 🎯
