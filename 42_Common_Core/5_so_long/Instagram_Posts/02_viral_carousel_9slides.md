🎮 This project just turned me into a game developer overnight! 

Swipe to see how I built a complete 2D game using only C and MLX42 ➡️

SO_LONG isn't just another 42 project - it's your gateway to understanding:
✨ 2D graphics programming mastery
🎯 Real-time game engine concepts  
💡 Player interaction and game states
🔥 Performance optimization for gaming

**The Mind-Blowing Journey:**
Started with an empty C file, ended with a fully playable 2D adventure game! The transformation is absolutely incredible! 🚀

**What I Actually Built:**
• Complete map parsing system (.ber file magic!)
• Sprite rendering and animation engine
• Collision detection algorithms
• Keyboard input handling
• Game state management
• Victory/defeat conditions

**The Technical Brilliance:**
Every pixel on screen is calculated and rendered in real-time. Understanding how MLX42 transforms your C code into visual magic? MIND = BLOWN! 🤯

**Real-World Applications:**
This isn't just academic - these concepts power:
🎮 Mobile game development
🖥️ Desktop application UIs
📱 Interactive web applications
🎬 Animation and graphics software

**The Gaming Industry Connection:**
Every AAA game uses these fundamental concepts! From indie pixel art games to massive open worlds - it all starts with understanding 2D graphics programming! 🌟

**Why This Matters:**
Game development teaches you to think about:
• User experience design
• Performance optimization
• Real-time systems
• Creative problem solving

Currently dominating Rank 02 at 42 Málaga and this project opened my eyes to the incredible world where code meets creativity!

**The satisfaction when your player character moves smoothly across your custom-designed level?** PURE EUPHORIA! ⚡
