**🧵 THREAD: My brutally honest journey learning to code - from "What's a function?" to building a working game**

*If you're struggling with programming right now, this one's for you.*

---

**1/15 🌱 THE BEGINNING**

Six months ago, I stared at a C file like it was written in ancient hieroglyphics. 

`int main(void)` looked intimidating. malloc() was a mystery. Pointers? Absolutely terrifying.

*I thought smart people were just born knowing this stuff.*

---

**2/15 😰 REALITY CHECK**

First week at 42: Complete impostor syndrome. 

Everyone seemed to understand things instantly while I was googling "what does compiler mean" and pretending to nod knowingly during peer discussions.

*Spoiler: They were all googling too.*

---

**3/15 🐛 THE DEBUGGING NIGHTMARES**

My relationship with segmentation faults:
• Day 1: "What's a segfault?"
• Day 30: "Not another one!"  
• Day 60: "Ah, my old friend seg fault"
• Day 90: "Actually, this tells me exactly what's wrong"

*Every error was a teacher in disguise.*

---

**4/15 💔 THE BREAKDOWN**

Week 3 of so_long: I spent 8 hours debugging why my character wouldn't move.

The problem? A single misplaced semicolon.

I cried. Actually cried. Over punctuation.

*And that was completely normal.*

---

**5/15 🤝 FINDING MY PEOPLE**

The game-changer: Admitting I was struggling.

Instead of judgment, I found:
• Others with the same questions
• People willing to explain things 5 times
• Study groups that felt like therapy sessions
• The realization that confusion is universal

*Community > competition.*

---

**6/15 💡 SMALL WINS MATTER**

First time my malloc worked correctly: I texted my mom.
First successful compilation: I took a screenshot.
First moving character: I recorded a video.

*Celebrating micro-progress kept me going.*

---

**7/15 🧠 THE MINDSET SHIFT**

From: "I'm not smart enough for this"
To: "I haven't learned this YET"

From: "This is impossible"  
To: "This is challenging right now"

From: "I'm behind everyone"
To: "I'm on my own timeline"

*The word "yet" is magic.*

---

**8/15 🔥 EMBRACING THE STRUGGLE**

Plot twist: The struggle IS the point.

Every confused hour strengthens your problem-solving muscle.
Every debugging session teaches pattern recognition.
Every "impossible" concept becomes possible with time.

*Difficulty is not your enemy.*

---

**9/15 ⚡ THE BREAKTHROUGH**

Week 4 of so_long: Everything clicked.

Not because I got smarter overnight, but because my brain had been processing all that confusion in the background.

The "aha!" moment felt like magic, but it was just accumulated learning.

*Trust the process.*

---

**10/15 🎮 BUILDING SOMETHING REAL**

When I finally played my own game:
• Character responding to keypresses I coded
• Collectibles I designed being gathered
• Win conditions I programmed actually working

*This is why we code - to create experiences.*

---

**11/15 📊 WHAT I ACTUALLY LEARNED**

Technical skills:
✅ Memory management in C
✅ Graphics programming basics
✅ Event handling systems
✅ File parsing algorithms

Life skills:
✅ Persistence through frustration
✅ Breaking complex problems down
✅ Asking for help effectively
✅ Learning from failure

---

**12/15 💭 THE REAL TRUTH**

Programming isn't about being naturally gifted.
It's about being naturally stubborn.

It's about showing up on the days you don't understand anything and trusting that understanding comes with repetition.

*Consistency beats brilliance.*

---

**13/15 🌟 TO EVERYONE STRUGGLING**

Your confusion is not evidence of inability.
Your slow progress is still progress.
Your questions are not stupid.
Your timeline is not wrong.

Every expert was once exactly where you are now.

*You belong here.*

---

**14/15 🚀 WHAT'S NEXT**

Currently working on: cub3d (3D raycasting)
Next challenge: Whatever 42 throws at me
Long-term goal: Building tech that helps people

*The journey continues, and I'm excited for every difficult step.*

---

**15/15 💝 COMMUNITY MATTERS**

The best part of this journey? The people.

If you're learning to code and need:
• Someone to vent about segfaults to
• Help debugging your C project  
• Just encouragement that you're not alone

My DMs are open. Seriously.

*We rise by lifting others.*
