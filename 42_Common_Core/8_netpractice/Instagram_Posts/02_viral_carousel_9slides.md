🌐 The Internet's biggest secret? It's simpler than you think!

Ever wondered how your message reaches someone across the planet in milliseconds? The answer is pure mathematical elegance.

🔥 Mind-blowing network facts:

Every device online has a unique 32-bit address. That's 4,294,967,296 possible combinations. But here's the genius part: they're organized into neighborhoods called subnets.

Your WiFi router? It's basically a postal worker that knows every address in its neighborhood and how to forward mail to other neighborhoods.

💡 What netpractice at @42malaga taught me:

• 192.168.1.0/24 = 254 usable addresses in one subnet
• Routing tables are just really smart address books
• Every packet knows exactly where it's going
• Network design is pure logical art

🚀 The "aha moment": Realizing that the chaos of billions of devices talking is actually perfect mathematical order.

This project made me fall in love with how elegant computer networks really are. Every Instagram post, every video call, every meme—all possible because of subnet masks and routing protocols working in perfect harmony.
