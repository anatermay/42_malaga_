📚 3 weeks ago I thought IP addresses were just random numbers...

This was my networking learning journey at @42malaga! From complete confusion to actually understanding how the Internet works 🤯

🧠 **My networking evolution:**

**Week 1:** "Why do we need subnet masks?"
**Week 2:** "VLSM sounds like a medical condition"  
**Week 3:** "OH! It's all just logical address organization!"

💡 **The breakthrough moment:**
Staring at 255.255.255.0 and suddenly realizing it's not magic—it's just really elegant math that lets billions of devices talk to each other.

🔥 **What nobody tells you about learning networking:**
- It feels impossible until it suddenly doesn't
- Every "stupid question" leads to a breakthrough
- Drawing diagrams by hand actually helps
- The moment it clicks is pure magic ✨

**Real struggles I had:**
• Mixing up network and broadcast addresses
• Forgetting to subtract 2 from host calculations  
• Confusing routing tables with ARP tables
• Thinking /24 meant 24 hosts (not 24 network bits!)

**What changed everything:**
Understanding that networking is just a really smart postal system. Every packet knows exactly where it's going because of this beautiful addressing hierarchy.

💪 **To everyone learning something new:**
That confusion you're feeling? It's not a sign you're not smart enough—it's your brain building new neural pathways. Embrace the struggle!

🚀 **From zero to understanding:**
- How your WiFi router actually works
- Why your home network uses 192.168.x.x
- How packets find their way across the Internet
- Why network engineers are basically digital postal workers

Currently tackling Cub3D (3D graphics) next. Because apparently my brain needed more challenges! 😅

What tech concept completely rewired your understanding of how things work?
