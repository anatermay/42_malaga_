can live in the same
digital neighborhood!

The Internet is just really smart math! 🤓

Subnet masks aren't random numbers:
- 255.255.255.0 = 24 bits for network
- Remaining 8 bits = 254 possible devices
- Each subnet = Digital neighborhood
- Routers = Digital post offices

Netpractice at @42malaga taught me this!

Mind = permanently blown 🤯
