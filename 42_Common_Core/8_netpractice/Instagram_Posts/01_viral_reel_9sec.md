🌐 POV: You just realized how the Internet actually works

This is your brain after completing netpractice at @42malaga! 🧠⚡

3 weeks ago I thought IP addresses were just random numbers...

Now I can:
• Design network topologies in my sleep 
• Calculate subnets faster than my calculator 
• Route packets like a network wizard 🪄

🔥 The moment everything clicked:
"Wait... 192.168.1.0/24 means I have 254 usable hosts?!"

Mind = BLOWN 🤯

Netpractice taught me that networking isn't magic—it's just really elegant math. Every packet knows exactly where to go because of subnet masks, routing tables, and protocols working in perfect harmony.

💡 Fun fact: Your WiFi router is basically a tiny network engineer making split-second routing decisions!

Currently dominating Rank 04 at 42 Málaga where every project builds on the last in ways that constantly surprise me.
