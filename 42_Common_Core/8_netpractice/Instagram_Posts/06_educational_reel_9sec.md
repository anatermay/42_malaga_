🔢 POV: You can calculate any subnet in under 30 seconds

This is what 3 weeks of netpractice at @42malaga does to your brain! 🧠⚡

**The Binary Method I learned:**

172.16.0.0/20 breakdown:
1. /20 = 20 network bits, 12 host bits
2. 2¹² = 4,096 total addresses
3. Minus 2 (network + broadcast) = 4,094 hosts
4. Range: 172.16.0.1 - 172.16.15.254

🔥 **Quick CIDR Reference:**
• /24 = 254 hosts (home networks)
• /16 = 65,534 hosts (large companies)
• /8 = 16,777,214 hosts (ISP level)

💡 **Pro tip**: Memorize powers of 2 up to 2³² and subnet calculations become instant mental math.

**What netpractice taught me:**
- Subnet masks aren't scary—they're just binary math
- Every network engineer needs this as muscle memory
- CIDR notation is the universal language of networking
- Understanding this unlocks network design mastery

🚀 **Advanced concepts covered:**
✅ VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking)
✅ Route summarization
✅ Network topology design
✅ Routing table optimization

This knowledge is essential for:
• Network administration
• Cloud infrastructure design
• Cybersecurity analysis
• System administration
• DevOps engineering
