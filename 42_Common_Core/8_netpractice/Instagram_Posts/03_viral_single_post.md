🌐 192.168.1.1 just became my favorite number

3 weeks ago, I thought IP addresses were just random numbers someone made up. Today? I can design entire network topologies in my head.

🧠 The netpractice project at @42malaga completely rewired my brain:

**Before:** "Why do we need subnet masks?"
**After:** "OH! It's like postal codes for the Internet!"

**Before:** "Routing tables look complicated"
**After:** "It's just a really smart address book!"

**Before:** "How do billions of devices find each other?"
**After:** "Mathematical elegance + protocol magic!"

💡 The breakthrough moment:
Staring at 255.255.255.0 and suddenly understanding that this isn't just a mask—it's the foundation of how EVERY device on Earth can talk to EVERY other device.

🔥 Mind-blowing realizations:
• Your router makes thousands of routing decisions per second
• Every subnet is like a digital neighborhood with its own postal code
• The Internet is basically the world's most efficient mail system
• Network engineering is applied mathematics at its most beautiful

This project didn't just teach me about TCP/IP—it showed me how human ingenuity created a system that lets 5 billion people share cat memes instantaneously across continents.

🚀 From confusion to clarity in 21 days. That's the 42 School magic.

Next challenge: Building a 3D graphics engine with Cub3D. Because apparently my brain needed MORE mind-bending concepts! 😅
