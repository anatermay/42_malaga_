  - Glowing cursor animation
  - Matrix-style green text effect for key functions
  - Subtle particle effects around code elements
  - Progress bar showing "Function Implementation: 100%"

### Animation Sequence (9 seconds)
1. **Seconds 0-2**: Screen starts black, green cursor appears, types "ft_strlen"
2. **Seconds 2-4**: Code structure materializes with glowing effect, showing function signature
3. **Seconds 4-6**: Implementation appears line by line with satisfying "click" sound
4. **Seconds 6-8**: "MASTERED ✓" appears with celebration particle effect
5. **Seconds 8-9**: Quick transition showing "43 functions completed" with achievement sound

### Audio Design

🚀 When you finally master all 43 functions in your first C library!

The satisfaction of building your own `strlen`, `strcpy`, `atoi` from scratch is UNMATCHED! 💪

✨ What I learned building libft:
• Memory management mastery
• Pointer wizardry 
• Function optimization
• Problem-solving mindset

Every function was a puzzle that made me a better programmer 🧩

Currently conquering 42 School's Common Core:
✅ Rank 00: libft (DONE!)
🔄 Rank 01: ft_printf, get_next_line, born2beroot
🎯 Next: Advanced algorithms & graphics

The journey from zero to systems programmer starts with understanding the basics. libft taught me that every complex program is built on simple, well-crafted functions.

💡 Pro tip: Master the fundamentals before jumping to frameworks!
