🔥 How I built 43 C functions from scratch and why it changed everything!

Swipe to see the complete journey of creating my first C library ➡️

When I started libft at 42 School, I thought "How hard can it be?" 
Plot twist: It was the most educational challenge of my programming life! 🧠⚡

Here's what building every function from scratch taught me:

💡 DEEP UNDERSTANDING beats surface knowledge
🎯 Memory management is NON-NEGOTIABLE  
🔧 Every line of code has a purpose
🚀 Debugging makes you a better programmer

The satisfaction of seeing "All tests: ✅ PASSED" after weeks of work? UNMATCHED.

This foundation prepared me for everything that came next in my programming journey.

✨ Currently mastering:
• ft_printf (custom printf function)
• get_next_line (file reading mastery)
• Advanced algorithms & data structures

Remember: Every expert was once a beginner who never gave up! 💪
