Here's the truth nobody talks about: my libft journey wasn't Instagram-perfect ➡️

42 days of real struggle, real breakthroughs, and real growth. No highlight reel - just the honest journey from confused beginner to confident programmer.

💭 THE REALITY CHECK:
Week 1: "I'm so smart, this will be easy!"
Week 3: "Maybe I should quit and become a barista..."
Week 6: "Holy sh*t, I actually understand programming now!"

🔥 WHAT THEY DON'T SHOW YOU:
• The 3 AM debugging sessions with terrible posture
• Crying over segmentation faults (yes, really)
• The imposter syndrome hitting HARD
• Questioning if you're "smart enough" for this
• The exact moment everything finally clicked

⚡ THE BREAKTHROUGH MOMENT:
Day 25 - I was explaining pointers to myself out loud (again) when suddenly... I GOT IT. Not just memorized - truly understood. Memory addresses weren't magic anymore. They were tools.

That's when libft transformed from "impossible assignment" to "challenging but doable project."

🎯 WHAT I WISH I KNEW THEN:
• Struggle doesn't mean you're failing - it means you're learning
• Everyone feels lost at the beginning (even the "smart" students)
• Understanding takes time, and that's NORMAL
• The foundation you build here pays off in every future project
• Community support makes the impossible possible

💙 TO EVERYONE STILL IN THE STRUGGLE:
You're not alone. You're not too slow. You're not "not cut out for this."

You're exactly where you need to be in your journey.

I see you debugging at midnight. I see you googling "how do pointers work" for the 100th time. I see you questioning everything.

Keep going. The breakthrough is coming.

Where are you in your programming journey right now? I want to hear about your struggles AND your wins! 👇

Let's build each other up! 🚀
