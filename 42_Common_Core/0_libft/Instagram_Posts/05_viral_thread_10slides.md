🚨 STOP copying C functions from the internet!

Here's the COMPLETE libft mastery guide that took me from confused beginner to confident systems programmer ➡️

After implementing 43 standard library functions from scratch at 42 School, I've cracked the code on REAL programming fundamentals.

💡 THE REVELATION:
Most programmers use functions they don't understand. When interviews ask "How does malloc work?" they freeze. When debugging gets complex, they panic.

🎯 THE SOLUTION:
Build every function yourself. Yes, it's painful. Yes, it takes weeks. But the deep understanding you gain is IRREPLACEABLE.

✨ WHAT YOU'LL MASTER:
• Memory management (no more mysterious segfaults!)
• Pointer arithmetic (become a memory ninja)
• Algorithm optimization (write actually efficient code)
• Debugging methodology (find bugs in minutes, not hours)
• Systems thinking (understand how software really works)

🔥 REAL RESULTS:
After libft, every subsequent 42 project felt easier. ft_printf? Implemented in 3 days. get_next_line? Logic was crystal clear. Complex algorithms? No problem.

The confidence boost is incredible. When you KNOW you can recreate any standard function, programming interviews become conversations, not interrogations.

⚡ PRO TIP:
Don't just copy the functions. Understand WHY each line exists. Draw memory diagrams. Test edge cases. Break things and fix them.

This foundation prepared me for everything: operating systems, databases, network programming, embedded systems.

🚀 YOUR TURN:
Ready to stop being a copy-paste programmer and become someone who truly understands code?
