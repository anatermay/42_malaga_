POV: You just implemented your first ft_strlen() function from scratch 🔥

The difference between copy-pasting from Stack Overflow and actually UNDERSTANDING what your code does? MIND-BLOWING! 🧠⚡

Before 42 School's libft project:
❌ "Why isn't strlen() working?"
❌ Copy-paste programming
❌ Zero understanding of memory
❌ Debugging = random fixes

After building 43 functions from scratch:
✅ "I AM the string library"
✅ Pointer arithmetic mastery
✅ Memory management ninja
✅ Debugging with precision

Real talk: Building every standard function yourself is PAINFUL but SO worth it! 💪

The moment you realize you can recreate any C standard library function? That's when you level up from code copier to actual programmer! 🚀

This foundation made everything else click:
• Dynamic memory allocation
• Buffer overflows prevention  
• Performance optimization
• Clean, readable code

To everyone still struggling with C fundamentals: Trust the process! Every expert was once a beginner who never gave up 🔥
